:sparkles: _こんにちは!_

This serves as the landing area for the organization (or betterly known as "project") of Dumb Vocaloid News! \
I know, the name sounds _really_ terrible but don't let that phase you- seriously. I decided to start this project as a way of getting central- **_reputable[!]_**- news about what may be going on in the vast vocaloid world. 

This project will _mainly_ start off with Hatsune Miku as I have been told that there is a lot to cover but then in the near future will this project branch out into different characters, singers, etc etc. \
As of right now, I am the only developer of this project while having a friend who is deep into the culture help me out with reputable streams & sources of information. \
_**I do not plan to add, endorse or integrate any type of Artifical Intelligence into this project.**_ This is a project that is more than a one-man and one-computer effort. Such as how the vocaloid world did not come to be from one-man, one-computer, neither should this project. That is also why I pledge that any repository that does not contain private information (aside from .env/enviroment files) will be made to the public to view, fork as their own and improve upon my own errors. It goes without saying that I would absolutely LOVE to work with others on this, especially with translations, source verification, graphical artists and last but absolutely not least, development!


If you would love to apply and become part of the team, please email me- I would be obligied to hear from you! \
~ Respectfully, \
  Andromeda \
